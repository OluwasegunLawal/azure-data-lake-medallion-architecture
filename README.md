# azure-data-lake-medallion-architecture
This project builds a complete Azure Data Lake pipeline using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) on UK public transport data. The goal is to engineer clean and structured datasets for a machine learning model that classifies journeys as 'peak' or 'off-peak' based on temporal and station-specific features.
